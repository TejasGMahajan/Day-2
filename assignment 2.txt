 typeof operand
typeof(operand)

a) typeof(1)
console.log(typeof(1));  //number
The data type of 1 is number.

b) typeof(1.1)
console.log(typeof(1.1));  //number
The data type of 1.1 is number.

c) typeof('1.1')
console.log(typeof('1.1')); //string
The data type of '1.1' is string.

d) typeof(true)
console.log(typeof(true));   //Boolean
The data type of true is boolean.

e) typeof(null)
console.log(typeof(null));    //object
The data type of null is object.

f) typeof(undefined)
console.log(typeof(undefined));  //undefined
The data type of an undefined variable is undefined.
The data type of a variable that has not been assigned a value is also undefined.

g) typeof([])
console.log(typeof([]));  //object
The data type of an array is object.
